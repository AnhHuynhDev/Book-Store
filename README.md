# Book Store

Online Book Store is the website application where the customer can sell and purchase books online.
This app is built in Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Bootstrap. It has the functionalities of online shopping website (create cart, add items, payment, etc.).
It also provides authentication and authorization for user and administrator to manage products in the system.
Besides, I also use Nodemailer to send automatic email to customers when they successfully sign up or want to reset the password.
